# Cybersecurity-Incident-Response-Digital-Forensics-APT-Attack-Investigation

As part of my Cybersecurity coursework, I conducted a detailed analysis of an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) attack on a global weather data analysis company, preparing pre-incident and post-incident response strategies to enhance organizational cybersecurity resilience.

ðŸ’¡ Project Overview

âœ… Pre-Incident Planning:

Analyzed and compared industry-standard Incident Response Plans (IRPs) to identify best practices for APT attack preparedness.
Recommended preventative security controls, including log monitoring, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and threat intelligence sharing.
Conducted threat classification and impact assessments to prioritize high-risk vulnerabilities.
âœ… Incident Response & Digital Forensics:

Investigated a successful APT breach where an attacker gained root access to a critical server.
Designed an evidence collection & forensic analysis methodology using tools like Wireshark, EnCase, FTK, and disk imaging techniques.
Implemented containment strategies, including network segmentation, access control changes, and firewall rule updates.
Developed a recovery plan, ensuring safe system restoration, data integrity verification, and continuous monitoring.
Conducted post-incident analysis, outlining key lessons learned and recommendations to prevent future breaches.
